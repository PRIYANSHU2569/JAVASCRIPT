    //module scope
    // 1. Variables declared inside a module are
    // not added to the global window object.
    // 2. Each module has its own scope.
    // 3. Modules are always in strict mode.
    // 4. To use modules, the script tag must have type="module" attribute
    5. Modules are deferred by default, so they execute after the HTML is fully parsed.
    6. Modules can import and export functionality to and from other modules using the import and
    export statements.
    7. Modules can be used to organize code into reusable components, making it easier to manage
    and maintain large codebases.
    8. Modules can be loaded asynchronously, allowing for better performance and faster page load
    times.
    9. Modules can be used to encapsulate functionality and prevent naming conflicts with other
    scripts on the same page.
    10. Modules can be used to create libraries and frameworks that can be easily shared and reused
    across different projects.
    11. Modules can be used to implement design patterns such as the module pattern, which helps to
    organize code and improve maintainability.
    12. Modules can be used to implement dependency injection, which helps to manage dependencies
    between different components of an application.
    13. Modules can be used to implement lazy loading, which helps to improve performance by only
    loading code when it is needed.
    14. Modules can be used to implement code splitting, which helps to reduce the size of the initial
    JavaScript bundle and improve page load times.
    15. Modules can be used to implement tree shaking, which helps to eliminate unused code and reduce
    the size of the final JavaScript bundle.
    16. Modules can be used to implement hot module replacement, which helps to improve the development
    experience by allowing developers to see changes in real-time without having to refresh the page.
    17. Modules can be used to implement server-side rendering, which helps to improve performance and
    SEO by rendering content on the server before sending it to the client.
    18. Modules can be used to implement progressive web apps, which help to improve the user experience
    by providing offline functionality and other features.

    19. Modules can be used to implement micro frontends, which help to break down large applications
    into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be developed and deployed independently.
    20. Modules can be used to implement component-based architectures, which help to improve code
    reusability and maintainability by breaking down applications into smaller, reusable components.
    21. Modules can be used to implement functional programming techniques, which help to improve code
    readability and maintainability by using pure functions and avoiding side effects.
    <script type = "module">

    <script>
        var  a = 10; // Global scope
        console.log(window.a); // 10
